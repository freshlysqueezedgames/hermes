# Hermes
## Path Based State Management System

Hermes is an alternative to other flux implementations that uses paths as addresses to locations in state data. It aims to reduce your coding overhead by dynamically creating your state tree from data payloads, and uses default reducers for Arrays and Objects without you having to explicitly define reducers for every node in the state heap.

It should also be encapsulated enough that using with any DOM Rendering Framework should be intuitive and easy.

Hermes is currently built to handle GraphQL communication, but I will be abstracting this in future work.
